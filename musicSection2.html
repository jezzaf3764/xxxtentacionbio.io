<p id="p1"> <font color="white"> XXXTentacion has created many well known songs, which include a touch of electronic music as well as masses amounts of autotune, using soundcloud. He is very well known for his lead single "SAD!" and his tribute to Joceyln Flores' death "Joceyln Flores",  which were both released in two of his latest albums "17" and "?" (Availible in shop). Here are his albums (in chronilogical order): Members Only, Vol.1 (2015) , Members Only, Vol.2 (2015) , It Wasn't Enough (2016, EP) , Free X (2017) , Members Only, Vol.2 (2017) , 21XXX (2017) , A Ghetto Christmas Carol (2017, EP) , 17 (2017) , ? (2018). His most famous songs include: LOOK AT ME! , SAD!, Joceyln Flores , Fuck love , Moonlight , Everybody Dies In Their Nightmares and finally Changes. 3X was known for his depressing, and at times, devestating music. He used music to release his anger, rage and irritation towards his single mother for barely being in his life and always being in and out whilst he was very young. As a child XXXTentacion completed a variety of criminal acts - including throwing a wooden chair at another childs head at school, so that he could grasp his mother's attention. </font> </p>
